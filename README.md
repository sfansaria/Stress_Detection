Stress Sentiment Detection Model
This model aims to detect stress levels in text data by analyzing sentiment and identifying patterns that correlate with stressful expressions. Built with a machine learning pipeline, the model processes and classifies text data into stress-related categories.

Key components include:

Data Preprocessing: Text is cleaned by removing URLs, special characters, numbers, and stopwords. This process enhances data quality for better model performance.
Sentiment Analysis: Each text entry is analyzed for sentiment polarity and subjectivity using TextBlob, offering additional insights into emotional tone.
Feature Extraction: TF-IDF vectorization converts the cleaned text into a numerical format, enabling machine learning algorithms to analyze linguistic features.
Model Training: The processed data is used to train multiple machine learning models, including Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
Evaluation: Models are assessed based on accuracy, precision, F1 score, and a classification report, identifying the best-performing algorithm for stress detection.
This Stress Sentiment Detection model is effective for identifying stress trends in large text datasets, making it a valuable tool for applications in mental health monitoring, social media analysis, and customer support.
